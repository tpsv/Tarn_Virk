							<h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #007BFF;">Commonwealth Bank of Australia – Hobart, TAS</h3>
							<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 10px;">Information Technology End User Experience | Jan 2024 – Present</p>
				
							<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
								In my current role with the Commonwealth Bank, I serve as a critical link between end-users and the IT security infrastructure. I’ve led tailored security awareness initiatives, training over 200 employees and boosting phishing detection rates by over 30%. My focus on proactive communication and technical literacy empowers users to adopt safe behaviors across more than 50 enterprise applications.
							</p>
				
							<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
								Beyond awareness, I’ve directly contributed to threat mitigation by identifying and escalating potential breaches — including five notable incidents that were neutralized before any damage occurred. Additionally, I optimized our internal AI support tool (Chat IT bot), running over 50 test cases and achieving a 30% accuracy increase, reducing IT response times significantly.
							</p>
				
							<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
								My work involves a hands-on approach to problem-solving, ensuring that users from diverse technical backgrounds receive clear, actionable guidance. I’ve documented key IT security procedures, built a knowledge base of over 100 articles, and worked closely with internal security teams to refine our response workflows — all while fostering a security-first culture.

							<p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 10px;">IT Operations Support | Apr 2021 – Dec 2023</p>
				
							<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
								At Woolies X, I worked in a high-pressure operations support environment where rapid, accurate incident resolution was essential to business continuity. I achieved a consistent 95% QA score throughout 2023 and maintained a 90% first-contact resolution rate by resolving technical and operational issues related to e-commerce platforms, logistics, and customer service.
							</p>
				
							<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
								My role demanded cross-functional collaboration — I regularly coordinated with logistics teams, store managers, and technical staff to ensure seamless service recovery. Whether managing incident reports or guiding stakeholders through technical fixes, I made sure communication remained clear and actionable.
							</p>
				
							<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
								Each day concluded with deep-dive analysis and structured reporting on incident trends and system outages. These reports helped the business identify recurring faults and improve service stability. I also contributed to upskilling initiatives, helping team members stay sharp in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.
